# News Feed and Trend Analysis Web Application

This project is django web app, used to diplay news data in real time, the app will have an entry "submit" to which news can be send using the post request, when this happens the server will use an sse(server side event) via a stream to send the data to the frontend and display the newdata as it comes, showing graphs, statistics and some algorithms.

Start the server and then run news_submiter.py to see the ongoing news.
